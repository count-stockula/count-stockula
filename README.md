###Problem

Small business experience difficulties keeping up with inventory levels. The POS systems can keep track of what is sold but keeping puts the onus of inventory level on the manger. This can be a manual process.

Count Stockula links the scanning of objects into an inventory system that will inform and keep the owners connected to inventory, even across multiple stores. Users login the system using an encrypted username and password. Each time scanned into the application it will reduce the inventory from the specific store. The user can manually enter in a upc, use a quick click dashboard to add common items or items that traditionally have upc code, such as produce. The user closes out the order by entering in as email address and a pdf receipt is generated and mailed out.
